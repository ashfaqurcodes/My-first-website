    <p>Hi my name is Ashfaqur Rahman, I am currently a student of United International University, I am doing an undergraduate program - Bachelor's of Business Administration (BBA), my major is marketing. I am at the last semester of my academic life and now looking for a internship. While looking for an internship I thought about my Career plan and I donot want to work in corpoarte sector for long time. So I am planning to be a freelancer or get a remote job for foreign companies as an alternative. From that planning, I decided to join Shikbe Shobai to get tips and tricks, and the skills needed to be better in this field.</p>
